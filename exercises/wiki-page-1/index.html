            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also 
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup> 
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) 
            is a feature observed in some tree species, 
            in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do 
            not touch each other, instead forming a canopy 
            with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> 
            This is most prevalent 
            among trees of the same species, but also occurs 
            between trees of different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist 
            many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive 
            behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown 
            shyness is uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> It has been 
            discussed in scientific literature 
            since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of 
            hypotheses and experimental results 
            might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, 
            an example of convergent evolution.
            <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the 
            interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of 
            adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas 
            suffer physical damage as they collide 
            with each other during winds. The 
            abrasions and collisions induce a crown 
            shyness response. Studies suggest that 
            lateral branch growth is largely 
            uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed 
            by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns 
            are artificially prevented from colliding 
            in the winds, they gradually fill the 
            canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances 
            of crown shyness between branches of the 
            same organism. Proponents of this idea cite 
            that shyness is particularly seen in 
            conditions conducive to this pruning, 
            including windy forests, stands of flexible 
            trees, and early succession forests where 
            branches are flexible and limited in lateral 
            movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this theory, 
            variable flexibility in lateral branches 
            greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.

            Similarly, some research suggests that 
            constant abrasion at growth nodules 
            disrupts bud tissue such that it is 
            unable to continue with lateral growth. 
            Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who 
            studied the crown shyness patterns in 
            eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the 
            trees' growing tips were sensitive to 
            abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.<sup>[13]</sup> 
            Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the 
            branches of <i>Picea sitchensis</i> 
            (Sitka spruce) and <i>Larix kaempferi</i> 
            (Japanese larch) suffered physical 
            damage due to abrasion, which killed 
            the leading shoots.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            A prominent hypothesis is that canopy 
            shyness has to do with mutual light 
            sensing by adjacent plants. The 
            photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance 
            response is a well-documented behavior 
            in a variety of plant species.<sup>[16]</sup> 
            Neighbor detection is thought to be a 
            function of several unique photoreceptors. 
            Plants can sense the proximity of neighbors 
            by sensing backscattered far-red light, 
            a task widely thought to be accomplished 
            by the activity of the phytochrome 
            photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of 
            plant respond to an increase in far-red 
            light (and, by extension, encroaching 
            neighbors) by directing growth away from 
            the far-red stimulus and by increasing the 
            rate of elongation.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly, plants 
            use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance 
            response, likely playing a role in the 
            recognition of neighboring plants,<sup>[19]</sup> 
            though this was just starting to be 
            recognised in 1988.<sup>[20]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The characterization of these behaviors 
            might suggest that crown shyness is 
            simply the result of mutual shading 
            based on well-understood shade avoidance 
            responses.<sup>[6][21]</sup> Malaysian scholar 
            Francis S.P. Ng, who studied <i>Dryobalanops 
            aromatica</i>, suggested that the growing tips 
            were sensitive to light levels and stopped 
            growing when nearing the adjacent foliage 
            due to the induced shade.<sup>[6][21]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            A 2015 study has suggested that 
            <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> shows different 
            leaf placement strategies when grown 
            amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics, 
            shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding 
            kin. This response was shown to be 
            contingent on the proper functioning of 
            multiple photosensory modalities.<sup>[22]</sup> 
            A 1998 study proposed similar systems 
            of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition 
            of growth as explanations of crown 
            shyness,<sup>[6][21]</sup> though a causal link 
            between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry 
            had yet to be experimentally proven. 
            This might explain instances of intercrown 
            spacing that are only exhibited between 
            conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
