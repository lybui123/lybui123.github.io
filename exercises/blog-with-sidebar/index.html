                    Originally, Courage the Cowardly Dog was created as a 
                    seven-minute animated short, "The Chicken from Outer 
                    Space". Dilworth started the animated short with 
                    Hanna-Barbera, sponsored by Cartoon Network and introduced 
                    Courage.[1] Dilworth graduated with a Bachelor of Fine 
                    Arts from the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1985. 
                    He became an art director and founded his own animation 
                    studio, Stretch Films in 1991, and incorporated in 1994.
                    [1] The character of Courage grew out of an earlier 
                    character of Dilworth's called Hamilton, who appeared in 
                    Smart Talk with Raisin, a pilot Dilworth created for MTV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The animated short was shown as one of the episodes of 
                    Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons in 1996, a 
                    Hanna-Barbera Cartoons innovation by then-president Fred 
                    Seibert. The short served as a de facto pilot for the 
                    future series.[2] The original animated short had no 
                    dialogue except for one line spoken by Courage, who had 
                    a more authoritative voice akin to Jackie Mason than in 
                    the series. It was uttered by voice actor Howard Hoffman 
                    who also provided all the other vocal sounds and effects 
                    for the short.[1] An alien chicken was the villain in this 
                    short, who later reappears in the series to seek revenge. 
                    His sons also attempt to seek revenge in an even later 
                    episode.[3] The short was nominated for the Academy Award 
                    for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards, 
                    but lost to the Wallace and Gromit short film A Close Shave.

                    Courage the Cowardly Dog follows Courage (Marty Grabstein), 
                    a kind yet easily frightened dog. He was abandoned as a 
                    puppy after his parents were sent into outer space by a 
                    crazed veterinarian. Soon after, he was found in an 
                    alleyway by Muriel Bagge (Thea White), a caring woman who 
                    decided to take Courage in as her own; the nature of this 
                    first meeting inspired her to give him his name. In the 
                    present, Courage lives in an isolated farmhouse with Muriel 
                    and her husband Eustace Bagge (Lionel Wilson in episodes 
                    1–33, Arthur Anderson in episodes 34–52), a cranky and 
                    greedy man who is jealous of Courage, refers to him as 
                    "stupid dog", and periodically uses the "Ooga Booga" mask 
                    to frighten him. The nearest town to the farmhouse is 
                    called Nowhere.

                    Courage and his owners frequently encounter monsters, 
                    aliens, zombies, and other paranormal or supernatural 
                    creatures that are attracted to Nowhere. Plots generally 
                    use conventions common to horror films. Although most of 
                    the creatures the three face are hostile, others suffer 
                    from distress, anger, and/or desperation, and sometimes 
                    they are friendly.

                    The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such dangers 
                    falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile with 
                    the monster of the week and remedy or repair any damages 
                    done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, 
                    the full extent of his efforts is usually performed 
                    unbeknownst to Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his 
                    name, Courage may be considered a genuine hero who often 
                    goes to great lengths to protect his owners, and a genuine 
                    coward who still expresses much of his distress with 
                    over-the-top, piercing shrieks.

                    Although episodic in nature, there are a handful of 
                    recurring characters in the show's cast, including 
                    Courage's sarcastic, sentient computer (Simon Prebble); 
                    the family physician Dr. Vindaloo (Paul Schoeffler); a 
                    fortune-telling chihuahua named Shirley the Medium (Mary 
                    Testa); Eustace's mother "Ma" (Billie Lou Watt); villains 
                    Katz and Le Quack (both voiced by Schoeffler), and the 
                    antagonistic Di Lung (Tim Chi Ly).
