                            <b>Chicken feet</b> are cooked and eaten in many countries. 
                            After an outer layer of hard skin is removed, most of 
                            the edible tissue on the feet consists of skin and tendons, 
                            with no muscle. This gives the feet a distinct gelatinous 
                            texture different from the rest of the chicken meat.

                        Chicken feet are used in several regional Chinese cuisines; 
                        they can be served as a beer snack, cold dish, soup or main 
                        dish. They are interchangeably called Fèng zhǎo (鳯爪, phoenix 
                        claws), Jī zhǎo (鷄爪, chicken claws), and Jī jiǎo (雞脚, 
                        chicken feet).

                        In Guangdong and Hong Kong,[1] they are typically deep fried 
                        and steamed first to make them puffy before being stewed and 
                        simmered in a sauce flavoured with black fermented beans, 
                        bean paste, and sugar;[2] or in abalone sauce.
                    </p>

                        In mainland China, popular snack bars specializing in 
                        marinated food such as yabozi (duck's necks) also sell lu 
                        ji zhua (鹵雞爪, marinated chicken feet), which are simmered 
                        with soy sauce, Sichuanese peppercorn, clove, garlic, star 
                        anise, cinnamon, and chili flakes. Today, packaged chicken 
                        feet are sold in most grocery stores and supermarkets in 
                        China as a snack, often seasoned with rice vinegar and chili. 
                        Another popular recipe is bai yun feng zhao (白雲鳯爪), which 
                        is marinated in a sauce of rice vinegar, rice wine flavored 
                        with sugar, salt, and minced ginger for an extended period 
                        and served as a cold dish. In southern China, they also cook 
                        chicken feet with raw peanuts to make a thin soup.

                            The huge demand in China raises the price of chicken feet, 
                            which are often used as fodder in other countries. As of 
                            June 2011, 1 kg of raw chicken feet costs around 12 to 16 
                            yuan in China, compared to 11–12 yuan for 1 kg of frozen 
                            chicken breast. In 2000, Hong Kong, once the largest entrepôt 
                            for shipping chicken feet from over 30 countries, traded a 
                            total of 420,000 tons of chicken feet at the value of US$230 
                            million.[3] Two years after joining the WTO in 2001, China 
                            approved the direct import of American chicken feet, and 
                            since then China has been the major destination of chicken 
                            feet from around the globe.[3]

                            cleaned, seasoned, and boiled, often with vegetables, and 
                            then cooled, to make an aspic called kholodets in Russian

                            are not always eaten, however, the chicken is cooked with 
                            its legs, as they contain a high amount of gelatin.
